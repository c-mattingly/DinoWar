## Introduction

The classic card game War with a dinosaur theme. I chose the theme because my daughter loves dinosaurs and I chose War because it's one of the games we enjoy playing together.

## Gameplay 
----
----
1. Begin by clicking the **Draw** button.
2. The first card for you and the computer will be turned over and the display will let you know who won the hand (based on which card was higher[hierarchy: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2] )
3. The winner of each hand wins that card and places it within their discard pile. 
4. When there is a tie the game enters a **War** phase in which an additional 3 cards from each player are stored in a winner's pot. The winner of those cards is determined by who wins the next hand.
5. If there is another tie, 3 more cards from each player are placed into the winner's pot and await the winner of the next hand.
6. Once the winner of the War has been declared they receive all the cards that have been stored and won in their respective hands. 
7. The winner of **DinoWar** is determined by having collected all 52 cards in their pile leaving their opponent with 0 cards. 
8. If you are ready to play again or just want to start over press the **New Game** button and the screen will be reset to the beginning. 

## Next Steps
